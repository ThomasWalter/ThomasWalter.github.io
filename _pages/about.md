Thomas Walter is a full professor at [Mines Paris](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu) and director of the Center for Computational Biology, a research group at Mines Paris. The group is also part of the joint unit between [Institut Curie](https://institut-curie.org), Mines Paris and INSERM: “Computational Oncology”, where he serves as deputy unit director. His research focuses on the development and application of Machine Learning and Computer Vision methods to tackle challenging questions in biology and medicine.

Thomas Walter received his engineering degree from Saarland University in 1999 and completed his PhD thesis at the Centre for Mathematical Morphology at Mines Paris, specializing in Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy, a severe and common eye disease. He then joined the Ellenberg Lab at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg, where he developed Computer Vision methods to analyze the first genome-wide RNAi screen by live-cell imaging in a human cell line in order to identify genes required for cell division.


In 2012, he joined the Centre for Computational Biology at Mines Paris, first as an independent researcher and, since 2018, as director. His work focuses on Bioimage Informatics with applications in High Content Screening and Computational Pathology. Since 2019, he has held a chair at the PaRis Artificial Intelligence Research InstitutE ([PRAIRIE](https://prairie-institute.fr)), and in 2021, he was appointed full professor at Mines Paris. He is also actively involved in teaching Computer Vision and Deep Learning for Bioimage Analysis in various courses at Mines Paris, PSL and beyond. 

He has published more than 80 articles (h-index: 34; GoogleScholar).
