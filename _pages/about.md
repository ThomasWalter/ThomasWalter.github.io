Thomas Walter is full professor at [Mines ParisTech](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu) and director of the Center for Computational Biology, a research group at Mines ParisTech, and part of the joined unit between [Institut Curie](https://institut-curie.org), Mines ParisTech and INSERM “Cancer and Genome: Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, Epidemiology of Complex Systems”. His research focuses on the development and application of methods in Computer Vision to biological and medical image data.

Thomas Walter received his engineering degree from Saarland University in 1999 and completed his PhD thesis at the Centre for Mathematical Morphology at Mines ParisTech in the field of Computer Aided Diagnosis of Diabetic Retinopathy, a severe and frequent eye disease. He then joined the Ellenberg lab at the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) in Heidelberg, where he developed Computer Vision methods to analyse the first genome-wide RNAi screen by live cell imaging in a human cell line. In 2012, he joined the Centre for Computational Biology and started his own team in the field of Bioimage Informatics, with applications in High Content Screening and computational pathology and mainly involving image segmentation, tracking and image classification. He has published more than 60 articles (h-index: 30). In 2018, he became director of the center. Since 2019, he holds a chair at the Paris Artificial Intelligence Research Institute (PRAIRIE). In 2020, he habilitated, and since 2021, he is full professor at Mines ParisTech.
