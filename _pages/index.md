I am a researcher in the field of image analysis and computer vision applied to biology and medicine. 

My current positions: 

- Director of the [Centre for Computational Biology (CBIO)](https://cbio.ensmp.fr)
- Codirector of the department [Cancer and Genome: Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, Epidemiology of Complex Systems](https://science.curie.fr/recherche/biologie-interactive-des-tumeurs-immunologie-environnement/c/)
- Chair at the Paris Artifical Intelligence Research Institute [PRAIRIE](https://prairie-institute.fr)


## Centre for Computational Biology (CBIO)

The [CBIO](https://cbio.ensmp.fr) is a research centre of [Mines ParisTech](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu), a major engineering school for applied mathematics in France. Our research focuses on the development of **Machine Learning methods** for live sciences, with applications both in fundamental biology and medicine. At the CBIO, we have 3 permanent researchers covering a variety of application areas, such as Chemoinformatics, Genome-Wide Association Studies, the analysis of electronic health records, phenotypic screening or digital pathology.

The CBIO has a strategic partnership with the [Institut Curie](https://curie.fr) and INSERM, and is part of the mixed unit [U900-CBIO](https://science.curie.fr/recherche/biologie-interactive-des-tumeurs-immunologie-environnement/c/) dedicated to Bioinformatics, Epidemiology and Systems Biology of cancer.  


## Bioimage Analysis at the CBIO and the Institut Curie

My own research field is **Bioimage Informatics**. My team develops methods and tools to analyse image data in biology and medecine. In particular, we develop computer vision methods to analyse cellular and tissular phenotypes.

The main application areas in my team are:
- **High Content Screening** : family of experimental techniques to perform hundreds / thousands of imaging experiments to test large panels of perturbations (such as drug effects or gene knock-downs). 
- **Digital Pathology** : imaging technique routinely used in clinical practice, where diseased tissue slides are stained and scanned. 

Our main workhorse today is Deep Learning, often complemented by traditional image analysis techniques and other data science techniques for down-stream analysis of the results.

    My research field is Bioimage Informatics, the branch of Computational
    Biology concerned with the computational analysis of bioimages.
    My most visible contributions have been in the field of computational phenotyping,
    applied to High Content Screening (HCS). 
    I develop computer vision and machine learning methods to quantify 
    morphological changes, classify cellular states and spatial trajectories
    from live cell imaging data with applications to systematic large-scale
    studies of cellular processes such as cell division and cell migration.
    These methods can also be used to find and phenotypically characterize new drugs.

    <p> More recently, I have become interested in the field of spatial transcriptomics where we want to systematically study the spatial aspects of gene expression. Methodologically this involves image simulation, point cloud clustering and classification. A second axis of my current research is the computational phenotyping of cells in their tissular context in histopathology data, a very competitive field with important clinical applications. From a methodological perspective, this involves deep learning and multiple instance learning in order to analyze very large, stained tumor sections used in the clinics for diagnostic purposes, such as metastasis detection or outcome prediction.</p>
   
    <p> I also coordinate the workgroup on High Content Screening of <a href="http://france-bioimaging.org"> France-Bioimaging </a>, I am active in a number of courses on Machine Learning and Computer Vision for Biology all over Europe, and I am also one of two coordinators of the Bioimage analysis activities of the <a href="http://imabio-cnrs.fr"> GDR ImaBio </a>. </p>
