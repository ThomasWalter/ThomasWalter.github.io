I am currently looking for two postdocs in the field of Computer Vision with applications in histopathology. In brief, we would like to predict the response to treatment from stained tumor sections. These images are very large and very complex and there are many methodological developments to be made in order to tackle these challenging questions. More details regarding the position and the application process can be found
