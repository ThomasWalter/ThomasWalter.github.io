I am a researcher in the field of image analysis and computer vision applied to biology. My current positions: 

Director of the  <a href="http://cbio.ensmp.fr"> Centre for Computational Biology</a> (CBIO) </li>
Codirector of the department "Cancer and Genome: Bioinformatics, Biostatistics, Epidemiology of Complex Systems" (Institut Curie / Mines ParisTech / INSERM)

My research field is Bioimage Informatics, the branch of Computational Biology concerned with the computational analysis of bioimages. My most visible contributions have been in the field of computational phenotyping, applied to High Content Screening (HCS). I develop computer vision and machine learning methods to quantify morphological changes, classify cellular states and spatial trajectories from live cell imaging data with applications to systematic large-scale studies of cellular processes such as cell division and cell migration. These methods can also be used to find and phenotypically characterize new drugs.
